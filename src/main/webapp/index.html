        <h1>CA2

            We started the project by cloning the 'security-branch' from the github-repository that was provided. We made change to the project so that it would be easier to start the backend-part in future projects.
            Hereafter we created a database consisting of the entities we needed to persist (user, password and userrole). We created the necessary password-protection by using hash/salt-strategy with JWT-tokens.
            In the backend we created the different classes, facades, endpoints and rescources. Afterwards we made tests for our facades and endpoints and commited the backend to our individual github-repos.

            We created a template for the frontend so that future projects would be easier to start. This template consisted of some basic components (Header, Footer, Login etc.) and some utilities (an api-fetcher for easy api-endpoint-accesss and a facade for our login-page).</h1>
